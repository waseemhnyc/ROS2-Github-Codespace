## How to View the Simulator (via VNC)

To view graphical simulations like `turtlesim` or Gazebo in your Codespace, follow these steps:

### 1. Start the VNC Server

Open a terminal in your Codespace and run:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/start-vnc.sh
```

### 2. Access the VNC Viewer
In the Codespace UI, go to the Ports tab.

Find the port mapped to 6080.

Click the üåç globe icon next to it to open the URL in your browser.

###  3. Connect to the Desktop
When the browser tab opens, select vnc.html

Click Connect (no password is required).

You should now see the graphical desktop where you can run tools like RViz or Gazebo.


## Launching Simulators

### Run turtlesim:

```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

### Run TurtleBot3 in Gazebo:
```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```
Or try the house world:
